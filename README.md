## Welcome to my Github! 👋
### Who am I? 🤔
My full name is Michael Aditya Larsson, and I am a 22 year old Half-Indonesian, Half-Swedish graduate from the Software Engineering & Management Bachelor at a mixed Program between the University of Gothenburg & Chalmers! 

A few quick facts about me:
- I've worked as a Teaching Assistant previously in Object Oriented Programming, RE-UX and Data Management 👨‍🏫
- I studied one year of Computer Science at the University of Delft
- I love sports, and play absolutely anything including football, tennis, padel and swimming ⚽
- I'm quite passionate in Web Development although a lot of the other areas in Software Development have also interested me 💻

### Projects 🛠️
Most of my project experience has come from university projects which includes a remastered version of the retro game Pong, a Scratch-like mini-car application and a Dentist website for citizens of Gothenburg. Other than this, I'm currently motivated and starting up some personal projects such as a portfolio website for myself, as well as some smaller application tools like a currency exchange app and possibly a finance tracker!

In terms of Languages that I am proficient in, this includes Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and I've learnt C and C++, however I'm less skilled in these two.
